# Sign transactions without needing confirmation in wallets like MetaMask.

> his project is aimed at rapidly creating a straightforward smart contract to increment a value.

> The primary goal is not to develop a sophisticated smart contract; rather, the focus is on creating a decentralized application (dApp) capable of sending transactions without requiring confirmation from your wallet.

> To implement this demo, a basic understanding of Web3.js is necessary, or alternatively, Ether.js can be utilized with slight variations.

> Additionally, a private key is required for the entire process.

> In this project, the Ethereum test network was utilized to retrieve all events from the blockchain.

> The choice of the Ethereum testnet was deliberate due to limitations on the number of events when querying networks like Mumbai Polygon.

> For instance, attempting to retrieve all events from Mumbai Polygon may result in an issue, as there are restrictions on the number of blocks queried.

> However, in the Ethereum testnet, everything operates smoothly without encountering such issues.
